# Comparitive Study of Module Systems

Code for studying Module Systems in Traditional versus Capability-Based Programming Languages

# Study Designs

The overall study consists of three designs. First, we ask participants to implement specific parts of the architecture using capability via external libraries or module systems
in languages. The design process of the study was made primarily by testing one of the facets of the overall goal (usability, extensibility, and security); however, the post-study
analysis was done by comprehensively taking in every factor. Each study was divided into three steps for participants - designing the initial architecture, finding vulnerabilities, and a post-study survey.

The studies are as follows:

1. [Logger Editor](Study/Logger-Editor)
2. [Network Pool](Study/Network-Pool)
3. [Simple Money](Study/Sealer-Unsealer)
